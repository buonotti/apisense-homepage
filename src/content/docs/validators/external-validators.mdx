# External validators

These validators are external programs taking in a definition and response data as JSON and returning the validation result.
They are user created and have no limitations except the in- and output.

## Interface definition 

### Inputs 

Validators get the following json object as input in stdin

```json 
{
    "response": {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "rawData": {},
        "url": ""
    },
    "endpoint": {
        "version": 1,
        "name": "",
        "baseUrl": "",
        "method": "",
        "payload": {},
        "authorization": "",
        "jwtLogin": {},
        "headers": {},
        "excludedValidators": [],
        "queryParameters": [],
        "format": "",
        "variables": [],
        "testCaseNames": [],
        "okCode": 200,
        "responseSchema": {}
        
    }
}
```

The `endpoint` property contains the definition used in this test case. The validator can assume that the schema matches so the data can be deserialized into a strongly typed type if possible. 

#### Slim validators 

If the additional context provided by the `endpoint` property is not needed the validator can be declared as "slim".

This leads to the input not containing the `endpoint` property.

### Output 

If validation fails the validator should exit with a non-zero exit code and print an optional message to stderr.

If the validator exits with code 0 Apisense assumes the data was valid 

## Templates

To ease the creation of custom validators there are templates for many languages.

### Official templates

The official templates are found in the repositories of the Buonotti GitHub organization. They have the following naming convention

```
validator-template-<lang>
```

Where `lang` is the name of the language the validator is for

### Installing templates

Templates are managed with the Apisense CLI.

To update the local index with the templates available in the remote repositories run 

```bash
apisense templates update
```

To install an unofficial template you can run the following command

```bash
apisense templates add --lang <lang> --url <git_url>
```

This allows to add a custom Git repository as a source for a validator template for a custom language.

You can also add an unofficial github profile/org to use as repository

```bash 
apisense templates add-repo --name <name> --url <url>
```

:::caution
Languages are unique so if you want to add more than one validator for a language make sure to name them differently
:::

To create a validator from a template run 

```bash 
apisense templates create --lang <lang> <name>
```

:::note 
Upon creation the template is saved locally for future creation.

To disable this behaviour pass the `--no-cache` flag
:::

If you want to upgrade the local templates to the latest commit run 

```bash 
apisense templates upgrade 
```
